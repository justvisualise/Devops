Kubernetes Series – Post 1

Kubernetes suna hai… but what exactly is it?

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform, introduced by Google in 2014.
Inspired by their internal systems (Borg & Omega), Google made it public so everyone can use and improve it.
Today, Kubernetes is maintained by the CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) and backed by thousands of contributors worldwide.

Okay… but why do we even need it? Can’t we just use containers directly?
Great question

Before Kubernetes – Monolith Era
Earlier apps were monoliths – one big block of code running on a server.
Scaling = buying a bigger machine. Easy to deploy, but not flexible.

Shift to Microservices
Companies broke monoliths into microservices – 50, 100, sometimes 1000 small services.
Each service had its own codebase, team, release cycle, and dependencies.
Containers (like Docker) helped by packaging each service with its environment.

But the problem? Managing hundreds of containers:
 Which container runs where?
 How to restart if one crashes?
 How to scale up during traffic spikes?
 How to connect them to each other?
Without automation, this was chaos.

That’s where Kubernetes comes in. It became the control plane – scheduling, scaling, healing, networking… all automated.

So basically, Kubernetes = automation for containers?
Exactly but let’s go deeper.
 Self-healing – If a container crashes, Kubernetes restarts it.
 Scaling – Got 10x more users? Kubernetes can scale services up (or down) automatically.
 Load balancing – Distributes traffic across pods.
 Rollouts & Rollbacks – New version deployment? Kubernetes rolls out gradually, and if something breaks, it can roll back.

So Kubernetes isn’t just “automation”. It’s the brain managing your application’s life cycle.


And what about cloud lock-in? If I use AWS, am I stuck there?
Earlier yes, because every cloud had its own APIs. If you wrote apps for AWS, moving to Azure was painful.
But Kubernetes changed the game 
All major clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP, even on-prem) support Kubernetes.
Apps run through Kubernetes APIs, not cloud-specific APIs.
That means you can build once, deploy anywhere.


Kubernetes is not just a tool. It became the standard way to run modern applications – scalable, portable, reliable.
This is why Kubernetes is everywhere – from startups to enterprises, from AWS to Azure to GCP.


Interview Corner
Q1. Why do we need Kubernetes if we already have Docker?
Q2. What problem does Kubernetes solve compared to monolithic apps?
Q3. How does Kubernetes help avoid cloud vendor lock-in?
Q4. Can you explain the self-healing feature of Kubernetes?
