The Architecture of a Kubernetes Cluster

If you’re new to Kubernetes, the word cluster can feel scary. But let’s break it down with a very simple comparison.



Think of Kubernetes like a big company.

Every company has:

Management (who make decisions)

Employees (who actually do the work)

Facilities (tools that help everyone work better)



Kubernetes works the same way.

1. The Control Plane = Management Team (The Brains )

This is the decision-making layer of Kubernetes. It doesn’t run your applications directly, but it controls where and how they run.



API Server → The receptionist or front desk.

Anyone (developers, admins, tools) who wants to interact with Kubernetes comes here first.

Example: You want to deploy an app → You tell the API server.



etcd → The filing cabinet .

Stores all information: which apps are running, which nodes exist, what the desired state is.

Without etcd, Kubernetes has no memory.



Scheduler → The HR manager.

Decides which employee (worker node) should run a new task (pod).

Example: If Node A has free space and Node B is overloaded → Scheduler sends the app to Node A.



Controllers → The supervisors .

They keep checking: “Does reality match what we wanted?”

If something crashes, they restart it. If a pod dies, they create a new one.


Key takeaway: Control Plane = The brains. It ensures the cluster always stays in the desired state.




2. Worker Nodes = Employees (The Hands )

This is where the actual work happens — your apps and containers run here.

Each worker node has:



Kubelet → The team lead .

Talks to management (API server).

Makes sure containers on this node are running correctly.

Container Runtime → The workers .

Runs your application in containers (Docker, containerd, CRI-O etc.).

If Kubelet says, “Run this app,” container runtime executes it.



Kube Proxy → The IT/network guy .

Ensures apps can talk to each other.

Also helps with load balancing between pods.


Key takeaway: Worker Nodes = The hands. They actually do the job assigned by the brains.



How to Visualise the Cluster

Control Plane (Bosses) → Assign work, keep records, track state.

Worker Nodes (Employees) → Actually run the applications.

Add-Ons (Facilities) → Provide support.

So whenever you hear “Kubernetes cluster”, just imagine a company where:

The bosses never do the work themselves (Control Plane).

The employees actually get things done (Worker Nodes).

And the facilities keep everything smooth (Add-Ons).


As a fresher, you don’t need to remember every component in depth right now.

Just remember who plays what role. Later, you’ll learn how they work internally.



Think of it like learning to drive:

 At first, you just need to know steering, brake, accelerator.

 Only later do you care how the engine works.
