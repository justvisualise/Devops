What the Kubernetes API Server Does

The API Server is the beating heart of Kubernetes.

Every client and every component — including kubectl — must pass through it.

It provides a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface over a RESTful API, allowing you to query or modify the cluster state. That state is safely stored in etcd.



But the API Server is not just a messenger — it also enforces rules:

Validation → ensures no one stores misconfigured objects.

Optimistic locking → prevents one user’s change from overwriting another’s during concurrent updates.



Even a simple kubectl apply -f pod.json hides a fascinating journey. Let’s break it down

1. Authentication – Who are you?

The first checkpoint is authentication.

The API Server uses authentication plugins to confirm your identity. It may:

Check your client certificate

Or inspect the Authorization HTTP header

From this, Kubernetes extracts your username, ID, and groups.



2. Authorization – What can you do?

Now Kubernetes knows who you are, the next step is: Do you have permission?

The authorization plugins verify if you’re allowed to perform the requested action.

For example → Can you really create Pods in that namespace?

 If at least one plugin allows it → the request moves forward.



3. Admission Control – Enforcing Policies

Before the object enters the cluster state, it flows through Admission Controllers.

These plugins can:

Modify requests (e.g., auto-fill missing fields)

Reject requests (if they break rules)

Impact other resources (not just the one you applied)



Common examples:

AlwaysPullImages → forces pods to always pull the image, ensuring freshness.

ServiceAccount → applies a default service account if none is set.

NamespaceLifecycle → blocks Pods in deleted/non-existent namespaces.

ResourceQuota → ensures namespaces don’t exceed CPU/Memory limits.



4. Validation & Persistence

After clearing Admission Controllers, the object is:

Validated

Persisted in etcd (the cluster’s single source of truth)

Response sent back to the client

And just like that → your kubectl command becomes part of the Kubernetes cluster state.



Key Takeaway

The API Server isn’t just a middleman — it’s a gatekeeper, rule enforcer, and record keeper.

Without it, Kubernetes wouldn’t have consistency, security, or stability.
